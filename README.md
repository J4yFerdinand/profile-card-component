## Project description
The challenge consisted of:
1. layout the profile card respecting the design for **mobile** and **desktop**.  
2. Apply good practices of accessibility and semantic HTML.  
3. Follow the style guide ([style-guide.md](cci:7://file:///d:/Ferdinand/projects/Fronted_Mentor/challenge_3/profile-card-component-main/style-guide.md:0:0-0:0)) provided.

## Installation and usage
1. Clone the repository:
 ```
 git clone [https://github.com/<your-user>/profile-card-component.git](https://github.com/<your-user>/profile-card-component.git)
 cd profile-card-component-main
```

## Technologies used
- **Semantic HTML5**
- **CSS3**
  - Variables CSS
  - Flexbox
  - Mobile-first
 
## Lessons learned
- I refreshed the use of Flexbox to center elements vertically and horizontally.
- Practiced using CSS variables to maintain a consistent color palette.
- I improved the semantic structure of the document by adding `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` tags.

## Possible improvements
- Add "hover" animations for an interactive effect.
- Modularize styles with a pre-processor (Sass) in future projects.
- Implement automated visual tests with *Playwright*.
